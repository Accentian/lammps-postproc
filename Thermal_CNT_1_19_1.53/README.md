# This file contains input files for running LAMMPS that can be used for post-processing using the Python script.

1. `Results` is a directory containing all the files used or placed for references, including the outputs and post-proc results (PNG images).
2. `xdirection_Thermal_CNT_1_19_1.53` is a directory of the MD run in the x direction. The CNT's length is in the z direction hence why this directory exists to keep previous runs.
